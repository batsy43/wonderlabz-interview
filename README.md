# Conditions 
Spend no more than 35 minutes on the test. 

The goal of the exercise is not to achieve 100% completeness but for us to observe your coding style. 

Consider your pair programming partners as Product Owners to whom you can ask questions.

Approach the exercise the way you would approach your usual tasks at your current work place. This includes asking the PO for details, using the internet, etc.

# Requirements
This is a simple application that currently prints out temperatures.

Implement a new feature to calculate the median and then re-factor the code to support an external service.

# Good luck!
